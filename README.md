**Project Description:**
A full-stack application developed as part of my University Dissertation Project, which earned a 1st class honour. The primary aim of the application is to provide everyday users with access to medical predictions for heart attacks and heart failure. This application has the potential to reform and reduce waiting times for the NHS in terms of cardiovascular diseases.
